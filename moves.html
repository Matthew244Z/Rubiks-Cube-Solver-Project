    <h1>Moves</h1>
    <p>In order to use the Rubik's Cube Solver in the home page you first need to know how to read the terminologies.</p>
    <p>These terminologies will tell you which side and in which direction to move the cube.</p>
    <p>Moves are separated into <a href="#basicMoves">Basic Moves</a> and <a href="#advancedMoves">Advanced Moves</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="basicMoves">Basic Moves</h2>
    <p>There are six sets of basic moves, one for each side of the cube, and they are: <b>U</b> for upper side, <b>D</b> for down side, 
        <b>L</b> for left side, <b>R</b> for right side, <b>F</b> for front side, and <b>B</b> for back side.</p>

    <p>All these terminologies are based on a point of view. The <b>F</b> is the front side that you are look at, the <b>L</b> is the
        left side of the cube (where your left hand is holding).</p>

    <p>For each side, there are three possible orientations: <b>normal</b>, <b>reverse</b> and <b>twice</b>.</p>
    <ul class="listMoves">
        <li>Normal: move side in clock-wise direction. It is represented by just a letter, like <b>U</b>.</li>
        <li>Reverse: move side in counter-clockwise direction. It is represented by a letter and an apostrophe, like <b>U'</b>.</li>
        <li>Twice: move side twice. It is represente by a letter and the number 2, like <b>U2</b>.</li>
    </ul>
